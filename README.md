# UX
### Project Goals
Whack-a-Mario is a game designed to give the user a fun, intuitive and interesting game where the time the mario pops up is completely random!

### User Goals
* Easy to understand and play as soon as the user lands on the game site
* Sounds responsive to actions (if they hit a mario)

### User Stories
* Having instructions available on how to play the game
* To see the current score
* To see the time left
* To play on different devices
* Design and Visually appealing
* Game Audio

### Design
#### Colors
Based on mario, so I've chosen a mario color pallete from [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.ie/pin/644366659198278801/).

#### Font
* The font used in the project is Electrolize from [Google Fonts](https://www.fonts.google.com). It was chosen because of it's retro/game look and feel.

#### Background Image
* The background image was taken from a free wallpaper download of [Mario Images](https://mrwallpaper.com/wallpapers/download-mario-wallpaper-nggsnupoh0ha4car.html)

# Technologies Used
This project was built using HTML, CSS and Javascript.

* Google Fonts
    * Used to style the text
* Gitpod 
    * Gitpod was used by the developer to build the game.
* GitHub
    * GitHub was used to store project code.


# Features
* There will be two buttons located at the top of the page, an About and Play Game.
1. As this game was designed to be on one page it was decided to use an About Button for the user to interact with if they need to understand how to play the game.
2. About Modal Box
* On click, the modal box opens with instructions on how to play. The background darkened to cover the game area. 
* This includes a hover state to let the user know they are hovering over it and it can be pressed.
* The instructions are fun, small and easy to understand. 
* The X to close the modal box changes colour on hover and located on the top right of the box.
3. Play Game Button
* This button is also located at the top of the page, alongside the about button.
* This includes a hover state to let the user know they are hovering over it and it can be pressed.
* This will launch the game into action.
* The button is deactivated during in-game play and reactivated once finished.
4. Timer
* The timer is displayed as Time Left:, it will count down from 60 seconds. 
5. Scoreboard
* The score is displayed at the top of the game area. 
* Successful hits of the super marios will move the score up 1 point. At the end of the game, you will see your final score.

# Features to Add
* I would really like to add levels to this game, increase the difficulty and make it more difficult for the user as they progress.
* It would also be cool to add a changing game container if the user passed a certain level, like if they hit over 20 marios, the game would change and they would need to hit moles, or pokemons, something to keep the user more engaged!
